I would like to create a side scroller souls-like game with mechanics that are similar to some of my favorite games I have played such as Hollow Knight, Dark Souls, Elden Ring, etc.. with a themetic similar to one of my favorite games, Subnautica

I am currently working on a side-scroller metroidvania game for my Capstone and am hoping that I can use some of the assets created in this project as assets to be used in my final project there as well, with many different core gameplay mechanics. 

The core mechanics I want to focus on are healing/managing set health, combat, a boss fight, looting weapons/armor, and creating an npc/shop in a hub area.

Inspirations: 

Hollow Knight: 
https://store.steampowered.com/app/367520/Hollow_Knight/

I would like to borrow the 2d side scroller style and some of the combat mechanics from this game

Dark Souls:

From Dark Souls I am interested in borrowing the looting mechanics and "estus flask" system.

Lies of P:

If I have time, I would like to figure out how to make a rewarding parry system similar to Lies of P 

Subnautica:

From Subnautica I would just like to use similar thematics with the ocean being the main theme and large, terrifying ocean creatures becoming bosses or enemies.
